University Project: Software Engineering (Second Year)
Project Overview

A coding theory project leveraging the ASP.NET Core framework with a JavaScript frontend and C# backend. The application focuses on implementing encoding and decoding techniques using linear codes for vectors, text, and .bmp format images.

-----------------------


Running project locally:
1. Navigate to '...\Linear-codes\backend'
2. Run 'dotnet build' and 'dotnet run' (or just 'dotnet run')

3. Navigate to '...\Linear-codes\frontend'
4. Run 'npm start'

-----------------------

Notes:
* User is presented a number and positions of errors between encoded vector and received vector;
* The bigger image the longer it takes to send/decode it;
